# CH pipeline

Backfills Swiss court decisions from entscheidsuche.ch into `ch_court_decisions`
on prod. Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-23-ch-corpus-pipeline-design.md`.

## Where it runs

On prod, always. 8 cores shared with live traffic, so stages are throttled by
`CHPIPE_CPU_WORKERS`, `CHPIPE_OCR_WORKERS` and `CHPIPE_LOAD_CEILING`.

## Stages

    index   enumerate documents, write metadata, fill decision_date
    fetch   download the body (html preferred, pdf otherwise)
    extract body -> text, with a measured quality score
    ocr     re-read the pdfs whose text layer failed the gate
    load    promote extracted rows to loaded

Each stage claims rows from the `stage` column with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.
That reduces overlap between concurrent processes, but it is **not** a
distributed lock: `db.connect()` opens the connection with `autocommit=True`,
so the row lock is released the instant the claiming `SELECT` statement
completes, not when the claiming process finishes its work. A second process
started moments later can claim the same rows before the first one writes
them back. **One process per stage is the supported mode.** Do not run two
copies of the same stage against the same spider (or against "all spiders")
concurrently; running different stages concurrently (e.g. `fetch` for one
spider while `extract` runs for another) is fine, since they claim from
different `stage` values.

## Running one

    chmod +x run-stage.sh
    ./run-stage.sh index                # all 54 spiders
    ./run-stage.sh index CH_BVGer       # one spider
    ./run-stage.sh fetch CH_BVGer       # one spider

`index`'s spider filter went through `CHPIPE_SPIDER` from the start for
`fetch`/`extract`/`ocr`/`load`, but `index_stage.py`'s `__main__` originally
read `sys.argv` instead and never looked at the env var — so
`./run-stage.sh index CH_BVGer` silently walked all 54 spiders. Fixed: its
`__main__` now honours `CHPIPE_SPIDER` (used by `run-stage.sh`, which never
passes argv) and still accepts multiple spiders via argv for a direct
invocation (`python -m chpipe.stages.index_stage SpiderA SpiderB`, useful
when driving `index` by hand instead of through the wrapper).

Under supervision, so it survives a disconnect and is visible:

    tmux new -d -s ch-fetch './run-stage.sh fetch'
    tmux ls
    tail -f /data/ch-corpus/logs/fetch.log

Liveness check, since a tmux session outliving its process looks identical to
a healthy one:

    pgrep -af 'chpipe.stages' | grep -v pgrep

## Retrying failures

Failed rows keep their `last_error`. Read it before retrying:

    psql -c "SELECT last_error, count(*) FROM ch_court_decisions
             WHERE stage='failed' GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 20"

Then, once the cause is understood:

    python3 -c "from chpipe.config import Settings; from chpipe import db; \
                c=db.connect(Settings.from_env()); print(db.retry_failed(c,'indexed'))"

## Gates

Never report coverage without these. See `chpipe/reports.py`.

- **Gate A** (`reports.gate_a`) — HTML/PDF/OCR split and mean quality on a
  sample, before committing to a full run.
- **Gate B** — `trg_jstats` fires correctly on the mass NULL -> text `UPDATE`
  that `load` performs. Not automated; verify by hand against
  `v_jurisdiction_fulltext_stats` before and after a `load` run.
- **Gate C** (`reports.quality_distribution`) — the distribution of the
  quality score itself, never a bare count of "rows with text".
- **Gate D** (`reports.completeness`) — our counts against entscheidsuche's
  own daily snapshot (`/docs/Snapshots/{date}.json`: `total` map and
  `total_alle` grand total). Returns three independently-scoped pieces —
  read `corpus` first. See the section below for why.

### Gate D: read `corpus`, not just `per_spider`

`Snapshots.total` is not a flat per-spider count. Checked against the
2026-08-20 snapshot (`total_alle: 793,500`), it is three nested views of the
*same* 793,500 documents, mixed into one flat dict of 519 keys, and each
view independently sums to `total_alle`:

- 28 top-level keys, one per canton plus `CH` (e.g. `ZH: 84411`) — a
  cantonal rollup.
- 131 mid-level keys, one per court (e.g. `ZH_OG: 29503`, `GE_CJ: 88373`,
  `CH_BGer: 177809`) — this is the granularity that actually corresponds to
  a spider.
- 360 leaf keys, one per chamber within a court (e.g. `CH_BGer_001: 27404`)
  — children of the mid-level keys, already counted there.

Of our 54 spiders (`index_stage.ALL_SPIDERS`), only **7** match a snapshot
key by exact string: `CH_BGE`, `CH_BGer`, `CH_BSTG`, `CH_VB`, `SH_OG`,
`TA_SST`, `TG_OG`. That is a coincidence of naming, not a mapping — those 7
happen to be spelled the same way in both systems. The other **47 spiders
have no matching key at all**, because entscheidsuche's court-level keys use
a different, shorter naming convention (`ZH_OG` vs. our `ZH_Obergericht`,
`GE_CJ` vs. our `GE_Gerichte`, `VD_TC` vs. our `VD_FindInfo`/`VD_Omni`,
`BE_VG` vs. our `BE_Verwaltungsgericht`, `TI_TRAC`/`TI_TCAS` vs. our
`TI_Gerichte`, and so on). At the correct like-for-like level (the 131
mid-level, one-per-court keys, which alone sum to `total_alle`), the 7
name-matched courts account for 216,963 of 793,500 documents — **27.3%** of
the corpus. A gate that only reported the 7 matched spiders would be worse
than no gate: a clean result would read as "the backfill is done" while
actually covering about a quarter of the corpus, and the other 72.7% would
never surface.

Rather than guess a `spider -> snapshot key` mapping across that nested
structure (fragile — a new naming quirk fails silently), `reports.completeness()`
now returns three pieces so the gate states its own coverage instead of
hiding it:

- **`corpus`** — `{ours, theirs, gap_pct, needs_investigation}`, our total
  row count against `total_alle`. Exact, level-independent, does not depend
  on any name match. **This is the number that actually answers "did we get
  everything" — always check it first.**
- **`per_spider`** — one row per snapshot key that matches a known spider
  name, unchanged in meaning from before (still `{spider, ours, theirs,
  gap_pct, needs_investigation}`, still a >1% gap flags
  `needs_investigation`). Only covers those 7-ish name-matched spiders — a
  clean `per_spider` on its own proves nothing about the rest.
- **`uncovered`** — `{key_count, docs, share_pct}` for the snapshot keys
  that match no known spider name at all — the gate's own blind spot,
  stated rather than dropped. Because `total` mixes the three nested levels
  above, `uncovered.share_pct` sums values from more than one level at once
  and can legitimately read over 100% — that is the nested structure
  showing through, not a bug. Do not read it as "percent of the corpus
  missing"; read `corpus.gap_pct` for that.

Call it as `reports.completeness(conn, snap["total"], snap["total_alle"])`.

## Deferred to the supervised operations phase

Everything below requires a human at the keyboard watching prod, not another
`chpipe` commit. Work through it in order; do not skip Gate A or Gate B to
save time before a full run.

- [ ] **Apply migration 196 to prod.** `mcp_backend/src/migrations/196_ch_court_pipeline.sql`
      adds the queue columns and re-enrolls all 678,165 existing rows (most
      of them back into `indexed`, since the existing CH_BGer text is
      mojibake — see the migration's own comment). Confirm the migration
      runner picked it up and check `SELECT stage, count(*) FROM
      ch_court_decisions GROUP BY 1` afterwards against the numbers the
      migration comment predicts.
- [ ] **Verify the legacy `ecli` format BEFORE running `index`.** Every
      upsert keys on `ON CONFLICT (ecli)` and builds its key as
      `ECLI:CH:{spider}:{doc_id}` (`es_document.parse`). If the 678,165 rows
      already on prod use any other shape, `index` inserts 678,165 duplicates
      instead of healing the existing rows, and `doc_id` stays NULL on the
      originals — which means `db.claim` will never hand them out and the
      backfill silently covers only the new copies. Run:

          SELECT count(*) AS total,
                 count(*) FILTER (WHERE ecli LIKE 'ECLI:CH:%')            AS ch_prefixed,
                 count(*) FILTER (WHERE ecli = 'ECLI:CH:' || spider || ':' ||
                                         split_part(ecli, ':', 4))        AS spider_shaped
            FROM ch_court_decisions;

          SELECT spider, min(ecli), max(ecli) FROM ch_court_decisions
           GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;

      Read the second query's samples by eye against
      `ECLI:CH:{spider}:{doc_id}` — do not accept the first query's counts
      alone. **`tests/test_es_document.py::test_ecli_is_stable_with_the_existing_678k_rows`
      is not evidence for this**: it asserts the format against the very
      function that produces it, so it is a tautology. Nothing in this repo
      has ever read a real `ecli` off prod.

- [ ] **Check how many rows `index` failed to key.** After `index`, before
      `fetch`:

          SELECT stage, count(*) FROM ch_court_decisions
           WHERE doc_id IS NULL GROUP BY 1;

      `db.claim` refuses rows with a NULL `doc_id` (it cannot write them
      back, so claiming them is an endless loop), and every claiming stage
      logs this count at start-up. A non-zero number here is work that will
      never be done: either the `ecli` shapes did not match, or those
      documents have been withdrawn from the entscheidsuche listing and
      cannot be re-indexed at all. Decide which, in writing, before
      declaring the backfill complete.

- [ ] **Gate B: confirm `trg_jstats` on the mass NULL -> text `UPDATE`.**
      `load` is the only stage that flips rows to `'loaded'`, which is the
      transition the trigger watches. Snapshot
      `v_jurisdiction_fulltext_stats` before running `load` on a small
      batch (`CHPIPE_LIMIT=500`), run it, and confirm the delta matches the
      number of rows actually promoted (`LoadReport.loaded`), not the
      number claimed.
- [ ] **Confirm tesseract's `deu`/`fra`/`ita` language packs on the prod
      box.** `ocr_stage` will silently produce garbage (or fail every row)
      if a pack is missing. `tesseract --list-langs` before the first real
      `ocr` run; install any of `tesseract-ocr-deu`, `tesseract-ocr-fra`,
      `tesseract-ocr-ita` that are absent.
- [ ] **Gate A on a 2,000-document sample.** Run `index` -> `fetch` ->
      `extract` for a handful of spiders capped around 2,000 documents
      total, then read `chpipe.reports.gate_a(conn)`. Look specifically at
      `by_source`, `ocr_pending` and `mean_quality` before committing to the
      full backfill — this is the cheap check that catches a systemic
      extraction problem before it burns hours on the full corpus.
- [ ] **Gate D against real production counts.** Run
      `reports.completeness(conn, snap["total"], snap["total_alle"])`
      against a fresh `/docs/Snapshots/{date}.json` and prod's real
      `ch_court_decisions`. Check `result["corpus"]` first — that is the
      real completeness number. `result["per_spider"]` is only trustworthy
      for the ~7 name-matched spiders; `result["uncovered"]` tells you how
      much of the raw snapshot dict still has no spider mapping (expect a
      large, possibly >100%, number per the nested-hierarchy note above —
      that is expected, not a new bug).
- [ ] **The full stage runs themselves**, in order, under `tmux`, one stage
      at a time per the "Running one" section above: `index`, `fetch`,
      `extract`, `ocr`, `load`. Confirm liveness with `pgrep -af
      'chpipe.stages'` after each backgrounded start, and check
      `stage_updated_at` progress periodically rather than assuming a tmux
      session that is still listed is still doing work.
